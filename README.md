# RESUME_RANKING_SYSTEM

In today's competitive job market, it can be a daunting task for recruiters to sift through hundreds of resumes to find the best candidates. That's where our project comes in. I have developed a powerful Resume Ranking System that utilizes advanced algorithms to automatically rank resumes based on their relevance to a given job description.

This system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze both the job description and the content of resumes. By extracting key skills, qualifications, and experience from the job description, we can identify the most critical attributes for a specific position. We then compare these requirements with the information provided in each resume, assigning a score that represents the degree of alignment.

With this system, recruiters can save valuable time and effort by focusing on the top-ranked resumes, increasing the efficiency of their hiring process. Job seekers can also benefit from this technology, as they can optimize their resumes to align with specific job requirements and increase their chances of getting noticed by employers.

This repository contains all the code and resources needed to implement the Resume Ranking System. Whether you are a developer interested in exploring the underlying algorithms or a recruiter looking to integrate this system into your hiring workflow, you'll find everything you need here.
