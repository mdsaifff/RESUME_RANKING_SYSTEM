# RESUME_RANKING_SYSTEM
In today's competitive job market, it can be a daunting task for recruiters to sift through hundreds of resumes to find the best candidates. That's where our project comes in. We have developed a powerful Resume Ranking System that utilizes state-of-the-art technologies, including Transformers and Google's Universal Sentence Encoder, to automatically rank resumes based on their relevance to a given job description.

Our system leverages the power of Transformers, a breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), to effectively process and understand the intricate details of both job descriptions and resume content. By employing Transformer models, we can capture the contextual relationships between words, phrases, and sentences, enabling a more nuanced analysis of the information.

To further enhance the semantic understanding, we incorporate Google's Universal Sentence Encoder. This remarkable tool converts textual inputs into high-dimensional embeddings, which capture the meaning and semantic similarity of sentences. By utilizing the Universal Sentence Encoder, our system can extract and compare the underlying semantics of job descriptions and resumes, facilitating accurate ranking based on relevance.

Through a combination of Transformer models and the Universal Sentence Encoder, our Resume Ranking System goes beyond basic keyword matching. It considers the overall context, identifying and weighing the most critical attributes that align with a specific position. The system evaluates the presence, importance, and frequency of the required skills and qualifications, ensuring a comprehensive and fair assessment of each resume.
